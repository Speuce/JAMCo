5. Wait.
6. Navigate to `localhost:3000` for the frontend and `localhost:8000` for the backend.
7. (Optional) Once the first dev container is set up you can open a new VSCode window, and repeat steps 2-4 for the other (front/back-end) container as well. This way, you'll have one window for frontend and one for backend open simultaneously.
